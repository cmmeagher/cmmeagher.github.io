		<h1>Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>Picking just two was quite hard, but I settled on <a href="http://www.okreal.co/" target="_blank">OK Real</a> and <a href="http://www.kinfolk.com/" target="_blank">Kinfolk</a>.</p> 
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>The OK Real immediately felt cool and you can tell a lot of thought went into how they display their content. I love the menu being after the lede story and image which makes it feel a little different than most other sites out there right now but not confusing. OK Real also does a great job of keeping the entire site feeling balanced despite the oversized images and text boxes. Overall, I had a super-positive response to what they've done.</p>
		<p>Kinfolk is definitely feels a little more mainstream. It follows a lot of the current trends in terms of size, space and balance, thus making it feel intuitive and super easy to navigate. The images are large and impactful without dominating the entire page and there is plenty of negative space allowing the user to know what the different groupings are.</p> 
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>What I like so much about both sites is that they have a clear hierarchy making the both approachable and navigable. But what I find so special about OK Real is the start imbalance driven by color contrasted by it's ultra-tight grid usage. It uses negative space sparingly, making the site all about the content. Kinfolk is, as I mention, much more approachable because it is more conventional. But that doesn't automatically make it boring or un-special; it still feels cool and holds interest.</p>
		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Homepage</strong></li>
			<img src="homepage.jpg" alt="Homepage">
		<p>The homepage thumbnail has a large image front and center that draws the user in and gives them a visual focus. Then, a very clearly visible bar with a prompt requesting the user to state their location - this could change, but I think this is a good starting point. At the top of the page there is an obvious main menu and a sub-menu at the bottom. I chose to build the site using a 12 column grid. While it gives the homepage nice easy balance, it will play a larger role in the rest of the site.</p>
		
			<li><strong>Results Page</strong></li>
			<img src="resultspage.jpg" alt="Results Page">
		<p>The results page has a clean and is, like the home, heavily visual. On the left side of the page are images that fills half the screen. And, on the right content about the brands is displayed - links, to their social media and contact information probably. The navigation will be sticky letting the user easily return home or go to other areas of the site.</p>
	</ul>
