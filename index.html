		<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

		<p>I'm an E-Commerce Strategist, living in Dallas, TX. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I'd like to gain a more comprehensive understanding of web for my current role and add these skills for future opportunities.</p>

		<h2><strong>My Mission</strong></h2>

		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Product Manager with Etsy or another company with similar principles because I like to work in a sustainably minded and innovative environment.</p>
